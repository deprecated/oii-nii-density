* [O II] 7330 / [N II] 6583 as a secondary density diagnostic

*** General features of the 7330/6583 ratio map

** Comparison with other density maps

*** [S II] density
[[file:screenshots/Screenshot-sii-density.png]]
*** [Cl III] density
[[file:screenshots/Screenshot-cliii-density.png]]
** Sensitivity to ionization effects
+ In principle, any offset between the O+/O++ transition and the N+/N++ transition could effect the ratio


*** Ionization maps

**** High ionization: [O III]/[O II]
[[file:screenshots/Screenshot-ratio-oiii-oii.png]]
**** Medium ionization [S III]/[S II]
+ But watch out for the density-dependence in this one
[[file:screenshots/Screenshot-ratio-siii-sii.png]]
**** Low ionization [O II]/[O I]
[[file:screenshots/Screenshot-ratio-oii-oi.png]]
**** Chlorine ionization

+ The [Cl IV] 8046 line is mainly from the central region, but it can actually be seen as far out as the bar - [Cl IV]/[Cl III] has a minimum at the bar
+ [Cl III]/[Cl II] behaves similarly to [S III]/[S II], except that it has the opposite density bias to sulphur: with chlorine, it is the ++ ion that is collisionally quenched.

+ The vertical lines are set at the [S II] density maximum and the [O II]/[O I] minimum, which should indicate the i-front
+ The [S II] and [Cl III] density profiles are very similar, apart from factor of 2 difference
+ The [O II]/[N II] ratio has a broader maximum, which I suspect might be something to do with the O^+ zone extending further inward than N^+ does
+ We should check that with Cloudy models



*** Profiles across the compact bar

+ We can see the progression of ionization gradients in the ratios at the Compact Bar

* 2D histograms
+ We should graph [O III]/[O II] vs [O II]/[O I] for instance
  + The oxygen lines are best because critical densities for all the lines are high compared with expected densities (except for proplyds)
  + Draw mixing lines between pure states
  + Compare with Cloudy models
+ Also [Cl IV]/[Cl III] vs [Cl III]/[Cl II]
  + This one needs to be corrected for the [Cl III] density, but we have that
+ [S III]/[S II] vs [Ar IV]/[Ar III] maybe
* Cloudy models
